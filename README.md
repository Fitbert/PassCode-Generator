# PassCode-Generator
 creating a passcode generator



## Challenge Week 3

We are creating a basic a passcode generation that will make a password to a legnth defined by the user that will include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. 

This was a great project that streatched my skills. While trying to make a basic generator i tried several different iterations of code to make an array for the letters( still working out the kinks there). Will continue to work on parts to make it better and more dynamic but a great learning tools. 

## Usage

This will be used to make passwords.
